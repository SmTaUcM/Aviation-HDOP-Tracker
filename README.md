# Aviation HDOP Tracker
From a GPS log, provides a visual Latitude/Longitude plot of an aircraft track. The plot will indicate portions of the flight where the Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP) was high.

- **Description:**
Using the provided GPS log, provide a visual Latitude/Longitude plot of the aircraft track. The NMEA message format used in the log is explained in this website: http://aprs.gids.nl/nmea/
The plot should indicate portions of the flight where the Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP) was high. For example, by using a red colour to indicate a DOP greater than 2.0.

- **What I Learned:** 
This project has seen me refine my skills at using the Matplotlib  Python package and has improved my skill at rendering images and plots using the Python coding language.
It has also served as a refresher in geospatial navigation calculations.
